# Putting noise and light together: Hello Cloud

After many hours of assembling it all together we managed to get something on the screen which, we think, a random person would call a "cloud". In the demo below we have a better density function, where we can tweak a lot of parameters such as cloud scale, noise weights, cloud and light density, just to name a few. We also removed the sphere container and changed it to the whole game object bounding box. This way we could create bigger area of clouds which can resemble a cloudscape.

Another example which looks like cartoon clouds. Note the Micky Mouse shape at around 10 seconds!

Also, when applying the detail noise (from noise generation blog post) we are able to achieve some incredible results:
